## What is this
I make some python scripts to improve operability of pythonista3 in iOS. You should add these script to custom shortcut in pythonista3.

### search.py
 search keyword in editor.

### goto.py
 goto line in editir
 
### snippet.py (depend on snippet_template.py)
 snippet.py is to replace keywords to context you frequently use. pythonista has snippet orginally. This snippet is more powerful than original snippet in pythonista. You can easy to add your original snippet. See snippet_template.py, please.
